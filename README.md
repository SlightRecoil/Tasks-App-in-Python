# Tasks in Python

I  started this repository after losing motivation on a Qt project. While working with Qt, I realized I wasn’t learning as much as I wanted, and although I knew what I had to do, I had troubles understanding my code as a whole.

## Structuring

It will be structured just like the old one, except that I'm coding everything in python.

## AI Support
  I've used chatgpt to assist with learning and commentation/documentation, as well as automating boring and repetitive tasks.
